Some of the advanced features of SyncEvolution depend on optional
packages.  In addition to the more obvious dependencies of the
backends there are more subtle dependencies:

- for good time zone support, libsynthesis must have access to
  either libical or libecal
- direct sync with phones depends on bluez and openobex
