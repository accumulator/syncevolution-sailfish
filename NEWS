SyncEvolution 0.4, xxxxxxx
--------------------------
* improved error reporting when selected server is not configured
* fix: in vCard 2.1 7-bit is the default encoding, so 8-bit
  UTF-8 characters are now avoided with quoted-printable encoding
  (illegal encoding had not caused problems though)
* fix for 0.4 pre 1: sending CHARSET is not allowed (and not
  needed) for vCard 3.0, so it was removed again (did not harm
  either)
* fix for 0.4 pre 1: sending vCard 2.1 to Synthesis server did
  not work because the new device info always mentioned 3.0 as
  the preferred format - now the preferred format matches the one
  that was configured and that thus will be used.

SyncEvolution 0.4 pre 1, 2006-08-06
-----------------------------------
* C++ client library revision "funambol30ga" plus the patches
  stored in its ".patches" directory:
  - the user agent string can now be modified in the
    spds/syncml/config.txt, but it is recommended to not set
    it explicitly. Then SyncEvolution will automatically insert
    its current version.
  - now compatible with additional servers (fixed some SyncML
    protocol issues, added support for sending device
    information)
  - revised API of the client library
  - #305795: for tasks the "text/x-todo" type from the configuration
    was sent to servers instead of the correct "text/calendar"
    provided by SyncEvolution itself
  - sync modes "refresh-client/server" can now be specified as
    "refresh-from-client/server" in the config
* updated default syncml/config.txt:
  - firstTimeSyncMode has never been implemented in the library,
    removed its documentation,
  - added documentation for userAgent
  - use "refresh-from-client/server"
* changed vCard parser to make it compatible with servers
  which send a verbatim semicolon as part of properties where
  the semicolon has no special meaning
* If minor errors occur like not being able to insert an
  item at the client or server side, then it is reported in the
  log and output, but the next synchronization will be a normal
  synchronization, not a forced slow one as in previous versions.
  The old approach ensured that the problem was noticed and fixed,
  but required user assistance. With the new approach synchronization
  continues to work, although without fixing the root cause of
  the problem.
* Workaround for bug in Evolution 2.0.6 (and perhaps other versions):
  for calendars and task lists not all deleted items were reported
  at once thus a single synchronization would only tell the server
  about a subset of the changes. Repeating the synchronization would
  eventually be told of all changes, so now this repetition is built
  into the code which queries for changes and a single synchronization
  is sufficient as it should be.
* Made it compile on Maemo 2.0, the Nokia 770 build environment, by
  adding "--disable-ecal". Not tested yet, though.


SyncEvolution 0.3, 2006-06-27
-----------------------------

* added syncing of calendars and tasks as iCalendar 2.0
* added syncing of contacts as vCard 3.0
* tested extensively with sync.scheduleworld.com and
  added an example configuration for it
* uses C++ client library revision "wmplugin_3_0_20"
  which contains several bug fixes, among them proper
  support for special characters and memory handling
  fixes
* much nicer listing of changes made during a sync,
  handled by the improved "synccompare" utility script
  (formerly known as "normalize_vcard")
* improved automated testing


SyncEvolution 0.2, 2006-03-19
-----------------------------

* added automatic backup mechanism and log storage,
  see "Automatic Backups and Logging".
* output no longer is the original log data, but rather
  a human-readable report of errors and synchronization
  results.
* "normalize_vcard" can now also compare two .vcf files
  directly.
* improved unit tests to catch more errors
* hide certain differences in vcards coming back from
  the server: duplication of extended vcard properties,
  missing TYPE=OTHER
* fixed client library problems:
  see http://forge.objectweb.org/tracker/?group_id=96&atid=100096
      #304792, #304829
* added some more problems to the "Known Problems" section


SyncEvolution 0.1, 2006-03-13
-----------------------------

* initial release
