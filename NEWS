SyncEvolution xxx, ????
-----------------------
* updated C++ client library: the user agent string
  can now be modified in the spds/syncml/config.txt: the example
  configs use "SyncEvolution" to override the default in the
  client library, which is "Funambol SyncML client".
  Existing user configurations have to be updated
  manually.


SyncEvolution 0.3, 2006-06-27
-----------------------------

* added syncing of calendars and tasks as iCalendar 2.0
* added syncing of contacts as vCard 3.0
* tested extensively with sync.scheduleworld.com and
  added an example configuration for it
* uses C++ client library revision "wmplugin_3_0_20"
  which contains several bug fixes, among them proper
  support for special characters and memory handling
  fixes
* much nicer listing of changes made during a sync,
  handled by the improved "synccompare" utility script
  (formerly known as "normalize_vcard")
* improved automated testing


SyncEvolution 0.2, 2006-03-19
-----------------------------

* added automatic backup mechanism and log storage,
  see "Automatic Backups and Logging".
* output no longer is the original log data, but rather
  a human-readable report of errors and synchronization
  results.
* "normalize_vcard" can now also compare two .vcf files
  directly.
* improved unit tests to catch more errors
* hide certain differences in vcards coming back from
  the server: duplication of extended vcard properties,
  missing TYPE=OTHER
* fixed client library problems:
  see http://forge.objectweb.org/tracker/?group_id=96&atid=100096
