SyncEvolution 0.2, 2006-03-19

* Added automatic backup mechanism and log storage,
  see "Automatic Backups and Logging".
* Output no longer is the original log data, but rather
  a human-readable report of errors and synchronization
  results.
* "normalize_vcard" can now also compare two .vcf files
  directly.
* improved unit tests to catch more errors
* hide certain differences in vcards coming back from
  the server: duplication of extended vcard properties,
  missing TYPE=OTHER
* fixed client library problems:
