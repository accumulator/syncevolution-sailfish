/**
 * @mainpage Getting Started
 *
 * This documentation for SyncEvolution and the Funambol C++ Client
 * API was generated automatically from the source code.
 *
 * While most of the classes in SyncEvolution are documented, very
 * little effort was spent on organizing this information in a coherent
 * way. If you are a developer who wants to write a SyncML client based
 * on the SyncEvolution framework, then you should have a look at
 * the following classes:
 * - TrackingSyncSource
 * - EvolutionSyncSource
 * - RegisterSyncSource
 *
 * The following classes help with testing your derived classes:
 * - RegisterSyncSourceTest
 * - ClientTest
