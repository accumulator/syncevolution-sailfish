/**
 * @mainpage Getting Started
 *
 * This documentation for SyncEvolution and the Funambol C++ Client
 * API was generated automatically from the source code.
 *
 * While most of the classes in SyncEvolution are documented, very
 * little effort was spent on organizing this information in a coherent
 * way. If you are a developer who wants to write a SyncML client based
 * on the SyncEvolution framework, then you should have a look at
 * the following classes:
 * - TrackingSyncSource is the most convenient class to derive from.
 * - EvolutionSyncSource is a bit more general.
 * - RegisterSyncSource adds additional sources to the framework.
 *
 * The following classes help with testing your derived classes:
 * - RegisterSyncSourceTest is what you have to use.
 * - TestEvolution uses that information.
 * - ClientTest, LocalTests, SyncTests are used by TestEvolution.
 *
 * The FileSyncSource is a good example to get started.
