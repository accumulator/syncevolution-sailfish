The code in this directory only gets compiled when SyncEvolution is
configured with --enable-dbus-service-pim. It uses libfolks and the
PBAP backend to implement a unified address book. This additional
functionality is provided via the org._01.pim D-Bus API.

That API is independent of libfolks and SyncEvolution. That it is
implemented inside syncevo-dbus-server merely simplifies the
implementation, by reusing some code provided by SyncEvolution
and the core Server class:
  * C++ D-Bus bindings
  * logging
  * D-Bus server life cycle control: delay shut down while
    clients make calls, inhibit shutdown while clients are
    registered, restart when files change on disk during system
    update, ...
  * direct access to SyncEvolution instead having to go through
    the http://api.syncevolution.org D-Bus API
