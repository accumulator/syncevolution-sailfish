The configuration templates in this directory get installed into
sysconfdir/etc/default.

When adding/changing a new server, then only enter the properties
which need to be changed here so that the default values can
be used for the remaining properties.

An icon can be added here for servers. The file name must start with
"icon".

Server configurations must be kept in sync in three different places:
- here (if a server is installed as files)
- in SyncEvolutionConfig.cpp's EvolutionSyncConfig::createServerTemplate()
- in SyncEvolutionCmdline.cpp's test server configs

Note that server icons must come with a suitable license that allows
redistribution. TODO: verify the license of ScheduleWorld and 
Funambol icons.
