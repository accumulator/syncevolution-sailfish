Usage
=====

The "pbap" backend provides access to an addressbook stored in a
remote device using the Bluetooth PBAP protocol. This is achieved
using the D-Bus services from obex-client (obexd), which needs to
be running.

The "database" property specifies the Bluetooth address of the
device to be connected.

The "databaseFormat" can be used as follows:

      [(2.1|3.0)][:][^]propname,propname,...

      3.0 = download in vCard 3.0 instead of the default 2.1
      3.0:^PHOTO = download in vCard 3.0 format, excluding PHOTO
      PHOTO = download in vCard 2.1 format, only the PHOTO

Valid property names are the ones listed by obexd in
ListFilterFields(). These fields may include:
     VERSION
     FN
     N
     PHOTO
     BDAY
     ADR
     LABEL
     TEL
     EMAIL
     MAILER
     TZ
     GEO
     TITLE
     ROLE
     LOGO
     AGENT
     ORG
     NOTE
     REV
     SOUND
     URL
     UID
     KEY
     NICKNAME
     CATEGORIES
     CLASS
     BITxy (for different values of xy)

Set "SYNCEVOLUTION_DEBUG=1" as environment variable when using the
backend to see a list of filter fields supported by obexd.

Syncing
=======

The backend itself is not able to detect changes since the last
sync, mostly because PBAP as a protocol makes that hard. For example,
it makes no guarantee that an item has the same ID in two different
sessions.

The intended use for the PBAP backend therefore is in the "slow local
cache" sync mode: always pull all data and let the sync engine update
a local database. The local database is not allowed to be modified
outside of the sync. Any such change may get lost at any time.


# configure backend
#
#
# Preventing a slow sync is possible in local-cache mode. It
# makes no sense for PBAP and thus has to be turned off.
syncevolution --configure \
                syncURL= \
                addressbook/backend=pbap \
		addressbook/database=obex-bt://XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX \
                preventSlowSync=false \
                target-config@pbap addressbook

# print items
syncevolution --print-items \
 	        target-config@pbap addressbook

# Configure synchronization.
#
# 'local-cache' expands to 'local-cache-incremental', which will try
# to do an incremental sync but be turned into a slow sync by
# the PBAP backend.
syncevolution --configure \
                --template SyncEvolution_Client \
                syncURL=local://@pbap \
                sync=local-cache \
                pbap addressbook

# run synchronization
syncevolution pbap
