The test case files are as follows (take itodo20.ics as example):
    itodo20.ics                      (common case for all servers)
    itod20.ics.funambol.tem          (server specific case)
During test, it will first try the server specific case(*.$server.tem), if not 
found fall back to the common case. 

To avoid redundancy, the server specifc case is stored as a diff(patch) based on
server common case; two make rules are added: patch2testcase in src/Makefile and 
testcase2patch in test/Makefile. patch2testcase is activated automatically when
you build the client test binary; while testcase2patch is to be used manually. 
When need to update the patch (triggered by update/add a server specific test
case or update a server common case in test/testcases), cd test/ and make
testcase2patch.
