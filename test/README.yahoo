CardDAV
=======

Not usable at the moment. Several valid test cases cause the server to
fail with a 500 error. Other test cases with special characters have
these characters replaced. Same with non-ASCII characters.

Tests pass only because all the problematic test cases were removed.
See git log for testcases/yahoo_contact.vcf.

Other data changes seen in server:
* first component in ADR removed
* TYPE=CAR not supported in TEL, complete entry removed
* TYPE=PREF stripped from TEL
* TYPE=PARCEL;TYPE=POSTAL added to all ADRs
* no distinction between TYPE=HOME,FAX and TYPE=WORK,FAX,
  both become TYPE=FAX
* no TYPE at all for EMAIL
* only one level in ORG
