ScheduleWorld resolves conflicts where the client deleted an item that
was updated on the server by deleting the item on the server (Bugzilla
#4369). Other servers always preserve the updated item in an update/delete
conflict, regardless which side has the update.

Advice: always sync before making changes. If it is too late for that,
copy items instead of updating them if they were deleted elsewhere,
otherwise the updated item may get lost later on.
