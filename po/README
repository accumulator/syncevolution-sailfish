Translation README

Syncevolution Moblin (GTK+) UI uses standard gettext translations (.po files)
and Transifex for translator web access.

What follows is a very short technical guide to translating. For more extensive
documentation, please refer to the GNOME localisation guide* or even the 
gettext manual** (the latter is unfortunately fairly programmer oriented).


Notes to translators
====================

1. Get the strings that need translating 

The easiest way to get the po-file is via 
http://translate.moblin.org/projects/syncevolution/ . If the file for your 
language does not exist yet, take the template file (syncevolution.pot) and 
rename it to xx.po, where xx is the language code).

Alternatively if you have configured SyncEvolution sources, you can get
an up-to-date template (.pot) and .po files by running "make update-po" in 
/po source directory.


2. Translate

Simply fill in the empty msgstr strings in the file. Graphical translation 
tools such as gtranslator are available in most distributions.

Two features a translator must know are c-format strings and plural form handling. 
For help with c-format strings, see GNOME Localisation Guide*.  

If there are untranslatable strings or you do not understand the context, please
file a bug on moblin bugzilla (product "SyncEvolution", component "GTK UI").


3. Upload

TODO: write this when translate.moblin.org situation is clear

Alternatively you can open a bug on moblin bugzilla and attach the po-file
there.



Notes to developers
===================

New translations are added by adding a .po file to /po-directory and adding
the language in po/LINGUAS. The translation website watches 'moblin-transifex' 
branch.
TODO: explain moblin-transifex in more detail: e.g. when should it be updated?

"make update-po" in /po source directory will update the translation template 
and all translations with new strings from the code: this does not happen 
automatically on plain "make".
TODO: transifex probably does this so this is only needed for testing new strings

When a translation is listed in po/LINGUAS, 'make' will build the message 
catalog (.gmo) and "make install" will install it.
